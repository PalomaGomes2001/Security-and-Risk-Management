Security and Risk Management 
Unit 1:
In this module, we created groups for the first submission in this Module. We learnt the different ways in which risk is defined and how it can be defined as an adverse event or annualised loss expectation when looking in business terms. it can also be defined as the net negative impact of the exercise of a vulverabilityconsidering the probability and impact of occurance. Finally, it can be defined as a state of uncertainty where the possibility of loss, injury, catastrophe, or an undesirable outcome are involved. Risk can be seen as the probable frequency or probable magnitude of future loss. 
The main concept of information security managment are confidentiality, integrity and availability. 
A threat is the potential cause of an unwanted incident which can lead to harm 
vulnerability is a weakness of a control that can be exploited by threats
the importance of these are dependant on the probability of it occuring which is how they are related to risk assessment 
An organization is split into the strategy system, the intellectual resource, the technology systen, the structure system, and the management system. 
The PDCA mandate should always be followed - plan, do, check, act
Ways to gather data include: risk modifications, threat workshops, business impact assessments, gap analysis and security audits. Qualitative AND quantitative assessment should be used. 
Risks can be classified: Eliminate, Tolerate, Reduce, Transfer
Mitigation includes: physical controls (security guards, CCTV, alarms), procedural controls (new processes), technical controls (adding or modifying technical components, firewalls, IDS, SIEM)
RISK = THREAT x VULNERABILITY x ASSET
Quantitative split into 4 areas: Actuaries, war quants, economists, management consultants
RISK IS SUBJECTIVE
These are all factors that were discussed in group meetings when planning a risk assessment document for a company. We used these to determine which security and risk standards were appropriate for the company we were given. We started by creating a whatsapp group and deciding on the best times to collaborate on this project. This was important because of the different time zones involved as well as different work schedules outside of class time. We were able to agree on a time that was suitable for everyone and this made collaborating online much easier. 


Unit 2:
In this unit we discussed the difference between qualitative and quantitative approaches
Qualitative assessment is used to foster trust between evaluators and participants. It allows for there to be an easier understanding of assessment results and can provide insights that help form strategies and improvements. 
Quantitative assessment helps to reduce bias in evaluations. This provides objective data and allows for standardized comparison of performance. 
The RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS consists of: Identifying the Risk, Analyzing the Risk, Evaluate/Rank the Risk, Treat the Risk and Monitor and Review the Risk. 
User participation can contribute to higher security control because of greater awareness, greater alignment between security review and business environment as well as imporved security control development. Users provide business knowledge that contributes to better security measures and teaches users how to protect their information. 
This helped in the group project because it made us take user friendliness into consideration when compiling information. It made us think about how to make the information and recommendations easier to digest and implement on a day to day situation. 


Unit 3:
A vulnerability is a technical issue based on dsign or implementation of a system.
A threat is any event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations such as mission, functions, image, reputation, assets or individuals through an information system through unauthorized access, destruction, modification or denial of service. 
Threat is a probability and is measured by a risk management process
It is evaluated through accept, avoid, control, transfer or monitor. 
There are values used as the basis of threat modelling and management
1. A culture of finding and fixing design issues over checkbox compliance
2. People and collaboration over processes, methodologies and tools
3. A journey of understanding over a security or privacy snapshot
4. Doing threat modelling over talking about it
5. Continuous refinement over a single delivery
Anti patterns are also used: Hero threat modeller, admiration for the problem, tendency to over focus, perfect representation.
threat modelling systems include: STRIDE, DREAD, PASTA, CVSS, Octave, Attack Trees, Trike, Mitre Att&ck, OWASP, Open FAIR
Understanding the differences between these techniques helped us decide which we would recommend to the client and why. It also allowed us to recommend whether or not it was necessary to combine techniques and why.


Unit 4:
In this unit we created models based on the suggested scenario with our groups
We created a document showing the risks and recommendations for our client while making the information easy to understand and implement by giving instructions on how to protect the company's assets. 
Group work is made easier when the group has allocated tasks to each member. We each had sections to work on and in the final days before submission, we sent our sections to our groupchat on whatsapp and I consolidated the information. We were also able to provide feedback on each other's sections before submitting the document so that we were handing in the best version of our work. We also all contributed ideas towards the layout of the document and the way the information was presented. 


Unit 5:
CASE STUDY: DUBLIN MINT OFFICE LIMITED 2018
The aspect of GDPR in this case study is marketing and the way companies collect data from people
Acomplaint was issued, an apology was sent to the complainant, a warning was issued to the Dublin Mint and the DPC decided to prosecute the Dublin Mint office for unsolicited marketing communications to which they pleaded guilty to two charges in relation to marketing telephone calls. This happened because the website did not have an opt-out option for tele marketing and only took emails into consideration. All forms of marketing need to be considered when asking clients if they would like to recieve promotional information in any form when registering online. 


Unit 6:
There are many security standards for websites. These make sure that a website is secure for the owner as well as for the customer. 
These include: sitewide SSL, verification of SSL, Obscure header info, enabling HTTP strict transport security, using HTTP only cookies, using secure cookies, securing the web server processes, ensuring the forms validate the input, protect against SQL injectioni attacks, protection against denial of service attacks, using regualr test configurations
This unit discussed which GDPR standards are applicable and this allowed us to choose which ones to focus on for the group submission document. We also reviewed case studies that helped us advise on mitigations to help a business succeed and meet the necessary standards in relation to GDPR and PCI-DSS.


Unit 7:
The Monte Carlo Method: define a domain of possible inputs, generate inputs randomly from probability distribution, perform deterministic computation on the inputs, aggregate the results. Based on the law of large numbers. As N approaches infinity, the average of the outputs approaches expected value. 
Bayes theorem is statistical theroy of conditional probabilities. 
Bayes theory can change depending on hypothesis
Anti patterns: Ambiguity, Inability to express ignorance is a failing of the system, Ellsberg paradox
Ambiguity: not all sources of uncertainty can be quantified
Inability to express ignorance: requirement of decision makers to have an opinion on every question answered. Abritrary answers may seriously change the calculated results
Elleberg paradox: ambuguity aversion since people prefer calculable risks. This is up to the decision maker and cannot be predicted. 


Unit 8:
This module discussed how to used quantitative risk modelling in real world problems and given situations. This unit helped to provide insight into how to choose a correct technique for a business to prevent loss of revenue based on a set of given scenarios. We learnt the differences between techniques by reviewing the avantages and disadvantages of each one. 


Unit 9:
Business continuity BC is an organizations ability to maintain and quickly resume acceptable levels of service following a short term event that disrupts normal operations. 
Disaster recovery DR makes restoring data easier so business operations can go back online quickly after a short term catastrophic event. They are used to minimize down time and date loss. 
Recovery Time Objective RTO is the maximum acceptable amount of time for restoration of a network and regaining access to data after an unplanned disruption. 
Recovery Point Objective RPO is the maximum amount of data measured by time that can be lost after an event before the data loss exceeds what is acceptable to an organization. 
Business Impact Assessment BIA predicts the consequences of a disruption to a business and gathers the information needed to develop recovery strategies. 
This unit helped me understand the requirements given to me for my final individual submission as the shareholder gave a required RTO for the comany. 


Unit 10:
This unit's reading was utilized in my final individual submission as it applies RTO and RPO requirements to the given scenario. I used the readings to examine possible solutions for the company and ways to implement these. The practical aspects of these solutions was put into my document as recommendations for the company as ways to protect as much of their data as possible in the event of an unplanned disruption. 


Unit 11:
There are other models used in economic and financial systems when dealing with risk manamgemnt. 
Real Options Theory: a framework that attempts to mitigate IT risk by using a set of mappings that defines how investments should be managed.
Options Pricing Theory: estimates theoretical value of derivatives based on other investment instruments taking the impact of time and other risk factors into account. 
Operations Management: takes into account cognitive biases, personal and social preferences and cultural norms on decision making in operations an supply chain management. 
Enterprise Risk Management: reaction against siloing 
DevOps: progression from the more traditional and business process oriented ITIL methods
All of these methods helped me decide which would be best to recommend to the client and to explain why in a way that would be easily understood and implemented.
